# Deep Learning Image Reconstruction
Basic Deep Learning pipeline for image-to-image prediction and reconstruction, mainly low-dost CT reconstruction
Disclaimer: code is old/work in progress since it was built from descriptions in literature from 2016/17
Converted data from dicom to nifti format, but it is recommended users take advantage of open-source CT datasets (e.g. https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1/data)
